## Overview

Front-end development for a landing page dedicated to a VR (Virtual Reality) company website. The layout incorporates a responsive design, achieved using CSS Grid for structured and flexible element placement, especially in featured sections. The main section includes interactive buttons that utilize a linear-gradient rollover effect with changing opacity, adding an eye-catching, dynamic visual when users hover over them. This approach enhances user engagement and aligns with the cutting-edge theme of VR. The design is fully responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile views, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices. This project was built from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no frameworks or libraries.

## My process

I initially built the website entirely for the desktop version, ensuring all elements met the design specifications. Once the desktop layout was complete, I adapted the design for mobile devices using CSS media queries. Additionally, the mobile version's main menu functionality is managed with JavaScript, allowing for a smooth and responsive navigation experience across different devices.
